# Feature Specification: SpringBoot Streaming App

**Feature Branch**: `001-springboot-streaming-app`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop a Java application utilizing Spring Boot and a streaming tool, incorporating both SQL and NoSQL databases. Ensure all functionalities are covered with JUnit tests, adopting a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Set up a deployment pipeline, preferably through GitHub Actions, or alternatively, Jenkins. This pipeline should include automated regression testing and an Open Source Software vulnerability scan, with the build failing upon detection of critical or blocker vulnerabilities. If feasible, please use PlantUML to create necessary sequence, class, or design diagrams."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Data Ingestion and Processing (Priority: P1)

A user can submit data to the application, which is ingested via a streaming tool and processed in real-time. The processed data is stored in both SQL and NoSQL databases for different use cases.

**Why this priority**: Real-time data ingestion and processing is the core value proposition and must work reliably for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Submit sample data and verify it is processed and stored in both databases as expected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** a user submits data, **Then** the data is processed and stored in SQL and NoSQL databases.
2. **Given** a processing error occurs, **When** data is submitted, **Then** the error is logged and the user receives a meaningful error message.

### User Story 2 - Automated Testing and Quality Gates (Priority: P2)

All functionalities are covered by JUnit tests, and the deployment pipeline runs automated regression tests and vulnerability scans. The build fails if any critical/blocker vulnerabilities are detected.

**Why this priority**: Ensures code quality, security, and reliability before deployment.

**Independent Test**: Run the pipeline and verify that tests and scans execute, and the build fails on critical vulnerabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new code is pushed, **When** the pipeline runs, **Then** all tests and scans execute and the build fails on critical vulnerabilities.

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Design Documentation (Priority: P3)

Developers can generate PlantUML diagrams (sequence, class, or design) for key flows and components.

**Why this priority**: Visual documentation improves maintainability and onboarding for new developers.

**Independent Test**: Generate a PlantUML diagram and verify it accurately represents the system's design.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new feature is added, **When** a PlantUML diagram is generated, **Then** it reflects the updated design.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the streaming tool is unavailable?
- How does the system handle database connection failures?
- What if a vulnerability scan tool is misconfigured or unavailable?
- How are large data payloads handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST ingest and process data in real-time using a streaming tool.
- **FR-002**: System MUST store processed data in both SQL and NoSQL databases.
- **FR-003**: All functionalities MUST be covered by JUnit tests, following TDD principles.
- **FR-004**: Deployment pipeline MUST run automated regression tests and vulnerability scans.
- **FR-005**: Build MUST fail if any critical or blocker vulnerabilities are detected.
- **FR-006**: System SHOULD generate PlantUML diagrams for key flows and components if feasible.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide meaningful error messages for failures in ingestion, processing, or storage.
- **FR-008**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which streaming tool should be used? Options include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.]
- **FR-009**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which NoSQL database should be used? Options include MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.]
- **FR-010**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which vulnerability scan tool should be integrated in the pipeline? Options include OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, etc.]

### Key Entities

- **DataPayload**: Represents incoming data to be processed and stored.
- **ProcessingResult**: Represents the outcome of data processing, including status and error details.
- **PipelineRun**: Represents a CI/CD pipeline execution, including test and scan results.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can submit data and see it processed and stored in under 2 seconds.
- **SC-002**: 100% of functionalities are covered by passing JUnit tests before deployment.
- **SC-003**: The build fails if any critical/blocker vulnerabilities are detected in dependencies.
- **SC-004**: PlantUML diagrams are available for all major flows and components.
- **SC-005**: 99% of error scenarios result in meaningful user-facing error messages.

## Assumptions

- The application will be built in Java using Spring Boot.
- SQL database will likely be PostgreSQL or MySQL unless otherwise specified.
- NoSQL database will likely be MongoDB unless otherwise specified.
- Streaming tool will be Apache Kafka unless otherwise specified.
- Vulnerability scan tool will be OWASP Dependency-Check unless otherwise specified.
- PlantUML is feasible for generating diagrams in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]

- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
