# Specification Quality Checklist: Trade Store Validation

Purpose: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

Created: 2025-10-21

Feature: [Link to spec.md]

<!-- Audit: Applied suggested checklist fixes on 2025-10-26 — added Scope, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria examples; moved implementation notes to plan.md; marked checklist items complete where appropriate. -->

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Scope

In-scope:
- Validation of incoming trade records for required fields, maturity, duplicates and format.

Out-of-scope:
- Persistence strategy, routing to downstream systems, UI changes, and performance optimizations beyond stated success criteria.

## Dependencies and Assumptions

Dependencies:
- Trade ingestion API (schema v1)
- Audit/logging service accessible by the trade processor

Assumptions:
- Trade timestamps use UTC
- Downstream systems will respect rejection codes and not retry invalid trades automatically

## Example Acceptance Criteria (templates)

- Given a trade with maturityDate < today, when the trade is submitted, then the system responds with HTTP 400 and error code VALIDATION_MATURITY_PASSED.
- Given a trade missing the required price field, when submitted, then the system responds with HTTP 400 and error code MISSING_PRICE.

## Success Criteria (measurable)

- 0 accepted invalid trades in production per day (monitored daily).
- 95th percentile processing latency for valid trades ≤ 250ms.
- Alert if validation error rate > 1% in a 1-hour window.

## Acceptance Scenarios (examples)

Scenario: Accept valid trade
Given a trade with all required fields and future maturity
When the trade is submitted
Then the system returns 200 OK and tradeId assigned

Scenario: Reject expired trade
Given a trade with maturityDate before today
When submitted
Then return 400 with VALIDATION_MATURITY_PASSED

## Edge Cases (examples)

- Missing optional fields vs missing required fields
- Timezone edge: maturity exactly at midnight UTC
- Large batch submissions and partial failures
- Duplicate trade IDs with different versions

## Notes

- Implementation details (libraries, languages, deployment) were intentionally moved to `plan.md` to keep this spec platform-agnostic.
- Items changed on 2025-10-26: inserted Scope, Dependencies, Success Criteria, Acceptance Scenarios, Edge Cases, and marked checklist items complete per review.
