# TradeMart Constitution

## Core Principles



### I. Code Quality

All code MUST adhere to strict style, readability, and maintainability standards. Linting and formatting tools are required. Code reviews MUST verify clarity, modularity, and absence of dead code. Rationale: High code quality reduces defects and accelerates onboarding.


### II. Test Driven Development (TDD)

Tests MUST be written before implementation. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. All features and bug fixes require passing tests before merging. Rationale: TDD ensures reliability and prevents regressions.


### III. User Experience Consistency

User interfaces MUST maintain consistent layout, terminology, and interaction patterns. All changes affecting UX require review for consistency. Rationale: Consistency improves usability and reduces user confusion.


### IV. Performance Requirements

All features MUST meet documented performance goals (e.g., latency, throughput, resource usage). Performance tests are required for critical paths. Rationale: Predictable performance is essential for user satisfaction and scalability.



## Additional Constraints

Technology stack MUST be Python 3.12 or higher. All dependencies MUST be documented in `pyproject.toml`. Security reviews are required for all external integrations. Deployment policies MUST ensure zero-downtime for critical services.

## Development Workflow

All code changes require peer review. Automated tests MUST pass before merging. Quality gates include lint, test, and performance checks. Deployment approval requires sign-off from at least one reviewer not involved in implementation.


## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval by majority of maintainers, and a migration plan for compliance. All PRs and reviews MUST verify adherence to principles. Complexity must be justified in writing. Use README.md for runtime development guidance.
